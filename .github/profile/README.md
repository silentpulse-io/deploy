# SilentPulse

SilentPulse is a security visibility monitoring system. It detects when security telemetry stops flowing or degrades, leading to detection gaps and blind spots in your security posture.

## What SilentPulse Answers

- When was security visibility lost or degraded?
- Which detection capabilities were affected?
- How long was the organization blind to threats?
- What actions should be taken to restore visibility?
